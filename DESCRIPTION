Description: scSeqR is an R package that can analyze single sequencing data types (i.e scRNA-seq) and large numeric matrix files (i.e. count tables with many samples from TCGA). 
  The program inputs single cell data in 10X format, large numeric matrix files and data frames and helps you to perform QC, filtering, visualization, normalization, clustering, differential expression analysis and find positive and negative markers for each cluster.
